UpdateMarcFields koha-plugin
==================

koha-plugin-updatemarcfields

The UpdateMarcFields Plugin for Koha is a plugin that enables EDS searching in the open source Koha ILS application found at https://koha-community.org/.  Development and testing are performed against the code published to the Koha community.  While EBSCO does attempt to address issues as they are reported, we can only test and support against the official Koha releases and cannot support modified Koha installs or modified versions of the plugin that have been forked elsewhere.  In addition, we cannot guarantee compatibility with other plugins. In order to best support our customers, we encourage pull requests and suggestions that are built against the standard release of Koha.

minimum Koha version required is Koha 22.05, according to the AddURLsToMarc plugin from which this one was derived, with plugins enabled
